**Coding Challenge (counting-the-bits.js)**: Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer. The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 2: April 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python3 which has been a delight. I think I will start using it as the main language in my coding challenges. Did more reseach into React Native and get the project files ready for tomorrow.

**Coding Challenge (time-converter.js)**: Write a function that takes the current standard time and converts it into military time.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 3: April 8th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Used python for the coding challenge today and I have to say its really growing on me. I love how its indent based instead of curly brackets. Very Cool! Also started to program my unnamed React Native app. Will post the link to the repo below!

**Coding Challenge (fatorial.py)**: Write a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of the number.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes
