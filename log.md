**Coding Challenge (sum-of-odd-length-subarrays.py)**: Given an array of positive integers arr, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return the sum of all odd-length subarrays of arr.

**Example**

```
Input: arr = [1,4,2,5,3]
Output: 58
Explanation: The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are:
[1] = 1
[4] = 4
[2] = 2
[5] = 5
[3] = 3
[1,4,2] = 7
[4,2,5] = 11
[2,5,3] = 10
[1,4,2,5,3] = 15
If we add all these together we get 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 15 = 58
```

**Coding Challenge (truncate-sentences.py)**: A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

- For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.

You are given a sentence s​​​​​​ and an integer k​​​​​​. You want to truncate s​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first k​​​​​​ words. Return s​​​​​​ after truncating it.

**Example**

```
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
```

**Coding Challenge (defanging-an-ip-address.py)**: Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

**Example**

```
Input: str = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

**Today's Progress**: Presented my capstone project yesterday and was really happy with the result. I hit a lot of my strech goals and was able to get farther then I thought I would. Now to start building my Portfoilo website and I do want to mess around with React Native
**Coding Challenge (defanging-an-ip-address.py)**: Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

**Coding Challenge Complete?:** Yes

**Coding Challenge (grading-students.py)**: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100 .
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

<h3 align='center'>Day 4: April 22th, 2021</h3>

**Today's Progress**: **https://github.com/DylanDrechsel/dungeon-dive** Today I started working on my capstone project. I decided to do a Gameboy inspired 8-bit web app with React.js. Im going to start doing research about what I will need this evening.

**Today's Progress**: Used python for the coding challenge today and I have to say its really growing on me. I love how its indent based instead of curly brackets. Very Cool! Also started to program my unnamed React Native app. Will post the link to the repo below!

**Coding Challenge (fatorial.py)**: Write a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of the number.

**Coding Challenge Complete?:** Yes

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python3 which has been a delight. I think I will start using it as the main language in my coding challenges. Did more reseach into React Native and get the project files ready for tomorrow.

**Coding Challenge (time-converter.js)**: Write a function that takes the current standard time and converts it into military time.

**Coding Challenge Complete?:** Yes

**Today's Progress**: Set up my Twitter account and started thinking of ideas for my capstone project. 

**Twitter Link:** https://twitter.com/dylandrechsel

**Coding Challenge (counting-the-bits.js)**: Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer. The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.
