# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Set up my Twitter account and started my project for hack week. The project is using react native to grab location data off the users phone and display it on the screen.

**Coding Challenge (counting-the-bits.js)**: Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer. The function should return the number of bits set to 1 in the number's binary representation.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 2: April 20th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python3 which has been a delight. I think I will start using it as the main language in my coding challenges. Did more reseach into React Native and get the project files ready for tomorrow.

**Coding Challenge (time-converter.js)**: Write a function that takes the current standard time and converts it into military time.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 3: April 21th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Used python for the coding challenge today and I have to say its really growing on me. I love how its indent based instead of curly brackets. Very Cool! Also started to program my unnamed React Native app. Will post the link to the repo below!

**Coding Challenge (fatorial.py)**: Write a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of the number.
**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 4: April 22th, 2021 
**Links to today's work:** Today I started my react native project to just display a map on the screen and pull the users location data. I am having some weird errors with MapBoxGL for react native. I am going to look more into it and see what the issue is. Right now it seems like its an issue with my node_modules

### Day 5: April 23th, 2021 
**Links to today's work:** Still working on my react native project. (https://github.com/DylanDrechsel/react-native). Found this really cool npm package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-device-info). However, I am getting similar issues to the MapBoxGL install. It seems to be a pathing issue which i hope to have sloved soon!

### Day 6 April 24th, 2021 
**Coding Challenge (a-very-big-sum.py)**: Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements.

**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 7 April 26th, 2021 
**Coding Challenge (grading-students.py)**: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100 .
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes

### Day 7 April 27th, 2021 
**Coding Challenge (defanging-an-ip-address.py)**: Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

**Coding Challenge Complete?: Yes
