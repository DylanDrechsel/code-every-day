<h3 align='center'>iterating over trees notes</h3>

trees have Nodes, Branches, and leaves

leaves is a node that has no children

we use recursion to access every node in the tree. To do this we have to use a public/private pair function. In the less were using 'collect' and '_collect'. 'collect' is the function that the user will call to return the tree in an array. while '_collect' is used in the function 'collect' and it uses recursion to iterate over the tree.
