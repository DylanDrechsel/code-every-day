// ARRAY VS LIST

// ARRAY
// - has a fixed size
// - you create an arrayby specifying its size
// - you can write to an array with: a[index] = value
// - you can read from an array with: x = a[index]

// LIST
// - has no fixed size
// - is often created empty, then values are added to it
// - you can add something to a list with a method: like l.add(value)
// - you can read something from a list with: x = l.get(index)
